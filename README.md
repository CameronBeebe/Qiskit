Beginning to learn Qiskit.

Thought I would try to teleport with GHZ tripartite state, if it works.  It seems like it should work in my head, but a worthwhile example to explore while learning.

Need to do more research and thinking about how GHZ state is shared and how Teleportation protocol might change (or not work at all...)
